  DialogueText: "This here\u2019s been around for as long as I can remember. Found
    it in my granddad\u2019s toolbox. He always said it belonged to some distant
    relative\u2014part of a family secret, or something. I never thought much of
    it. Just kept it around. But maybe it\u2019s meant for someone like you."
