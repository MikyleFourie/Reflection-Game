  DialogueText: "That bridge was supposed to connect our town to the land across.
    My design. It was going to bring prosperity to the place. Instead, it brought...
    other things. Tension. Conflict. Our friend group broke apart\r\nnot long after.
    If you want answers, head to the town. You\u2019ll see what I mean. Just don\u2019t
    expect to like what\r\nyou find."
